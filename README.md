Install
-------
#### Clone
As this package is not on melpa (yet), clone this repo and use ```package-install-file``` to install **atheme**. If you prefer, you can use [quelpa](https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa) as well.

#### Startup
To enable **atheme** on Emacs startup, add the following to your init.el:

```elisp
(require 'atheme)

;; my (installed) themes to choose from or cycle through
;; first theme is default
(athemes-theme-list '(doom-tomorrow-day
                      doom-tomorrow-night
                      dracula
                      gruvbov-dark-medium
                      gruvbov-light-medium
                      leuven
                      material
                      zenburn
                      ;; this theme is a function, so suffix with "-M-x"
                      color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-day-M-x
                     ))
;; startup with first theme from athemes-theme-list
(atheme-next-theme)
;; my startup theme
;; (atheme-load-theme 'zenburn)))
```

#### Dependency
This package depends on [ivy](https://melpa.org/#/ivy), so please make sure that has been installed as well. This package does not include themes, these need to be installed separately for example through [Melpa](https://melpa.org).
